    <h2>Daniel Quinn</h2>
</h2>
<p> Hello! I am Daniel and I am from San Diego, CA</p>
<p>I'm 19 years old and I have completed 2 semesters so far, so I am a sophmore here.</p>
    I am a computer engineer major and I just recently changed my major to this, so I am fairly new to this stuff. 

<p>I like to hang out at the beach when I'm in town and I like to collect records, figures, and other stuff </p>
<p> I have recently gotten into hiking, but when it comes to physical activities, I have always enjoyed going to the gym, playing lacrosse, and swimming
